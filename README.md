3. ➗ Simple Calculator
A basic calculator that performs simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes error handling for invalid inputs, including division by zero.

Key Features:
Support for four basic operations
Input validation
Simple, user-friendly interface
4. ✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
A fun and interactive game where the user plays Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The computer’s choice is randomly generated each round.

Key Features:
Play multiple rounds against the computer
Randomized computer moves
Scoring system to track wins, losses, and ties
User-friendly interface and input validation
Technologies Used:
Python 3 for scripting
Basic libraries like random, sys, and math (no external dependencies)
Future Enhancements:
Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for some of the projects.
Expanding the To-Do List with priority levels and deadlines.
Improving error handling and customization in the Password Generator.
Enhancing the Rock, Paper, Scissors game with more features like game modes or animations.

5. 🕒 Digital Clock with Alarm (Python + Tkinter)
📌 Project Overview
A simple digital clock built with Python's `tkinter` GUI library.  
It displays the current time & date, updates every second, and allows you to set an alarm.
 🚀 Features
- ⏰ Real-time digital clock
- 📅 Shows current date
- 🌈 Dynamic colors based on time of day (morning/day/night)
- 🔔 Alarm functionality (enter time in `HH:MM:SS AM/PM` format)

 📂 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- tkinter (pre-installed with Python)


Unit Converter
## 📌 Overview
A simple **CLI Unit Converter** built with Python.  
It supports conversions between:
- Kilometers ↔ Miles
- Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit

## 🚀 Features
- Easy-to-use CLI menu
- Error handling for invalid input
- Modular functions for each conversion

## 📂 Requirements
- Python 3.x (no external libraries needed)
  
🔧 Possible Improvements
Add more units (meters ↔ feet, kg ↔ pounds, liters ↔ gallons, etc.)
Add loop to keep converting until user exits
Create a GUI version using Tkinter

🎯 Python Project: Multiplayer Number Guessing Game (GUI)

 📌 Overview
A fun **multiplayer number guessing game** built with Python and Tkinter.  
- **Player 1** secretly sets a number (1–100).  
- **Player 2** guesses the number within limited attempts.  
- Game provides feedback (**Too High / Too Low / Correct**).  
- Supports **reset** for new rounds.  

 🚀 Features
- 🖥️ Graphical User Interface with Tkinter  
- 🔒 Player 1’s number entry is hidden (`*`)  
- 🎮 Player 2 guesses with feedback  
- 🎯 Limited attempts (default = 7)  
- 🔁 Reset button for replay  

 📂 Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)  

🔧 Possible Improvements
Add difficulty levels (Easy = 10 attempts, Hard = 5 attempts)
Auto-switch roles between Player 1 and Player 2
Display history of guesses
Add background music or sound effects
